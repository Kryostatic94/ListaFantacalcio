# ListaFantacalcio

This is a list made with Vanilla JS inside HTML to provide a list for auctions for Fantasy Football Game(as we usually call it in Italy: Fantacalcio).
It works for the standard teams:

3 Goalkeepers
<br>
8 Defenders
<br>
8 Mid-fielders
<br>
6 Strikers
<br>

You can add as many credits you want, and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js#license"><strong>html2pdf.js</strong></a> you can save your list as a PDF wherever you want.

This is an exercise I've made just for training purposes, I'm still a student any suggestions would be really appreciated.
